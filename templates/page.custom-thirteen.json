Check the LED indicator light on the CANsmart, if the indicator light is flashing red than a fuse has been tripped and value needs to be increased using the Accessory Manager Software.<br\/> <br\/> 7. Check that all harness connections and wiring to the auxiliary lights are solid and free of shorts.<br\/> <br\/> 8. It’s possible that the accessory is defective rather than the CANsmart. Be sure to bench test the accessory by powering it directly from the vehicles battery or an alternative 12v DC power source to insure the accessory functions standalone.<\/p>","ac_heading_7":"My brake light circuit is not working as expected.","ac_content_7":"<p><strong>The Auxiliary Brake Light is not functioning?<\/strong><\/p><p>1.

It is possible that one of the wires in the B6 brake light wiring adapter (pigtail) has lost contact with the connector terminal. Use a voltmeter to confirm there is continuity from one end of the pigtail to the other. If not, DENALI will replace the wiring adapter free of charge.<\/p><p><strong>The Brake Light’s “Auto-Flash (Declaration Activated Flashing)” feature is not functioning?<\/strong><\/p><p>There is some confusion regarding the Auto-Flash feature and how it is supposed to function.<\/p><p>1. Auto-Flash only works above activates above 30mph (50km\/h) <\/p><p>2. The sensitivity of the system can be adjusted in the extra settings window. The default deceleration rate at which the light will activate is 12.4mph\/sec., changing this to \"More Sensitive\" changes the value to 11.8mph\/sec..<\/p><p>3. If deceleration is due to active braking, the flashing will continue until both brakes are released. If deceleration is due to engine braking, the flashing will continue until deceleration is less than the deceleration threshold or vehicle speed is less than 30mph.<\/p><p>4. Auto brake flashing on tap-off will only flash if the deceleration is over the threshold, which is not typically long in these cases. The light will flash a minimum of two times if the deceleration goes over the threshold and the brake is not active. If the brake is active the light will continue to flash until the brake is released.<\/p><p>5. The harsh deceleration limits do require a rather hard deceleration to trigger, which is difficult to achieve when just tapping off the throttle. If we updated the sensitivity to be any lower than the thresholds that are in the software, then the brake light tends to trigger on a normal braking event, which is not what should happen.<\/p>","ac_heading_8":"My horn circuit is not working as expected.","ac_content_8":"<p>1.
